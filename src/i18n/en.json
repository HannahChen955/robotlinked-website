      "title": "Talent Services",
      "q1": "How quickly can you deliver qualified candidates for AI hardware roles?",
      "a1": "We deliver first candidate batch within 48 hours for most roles. Our extensive network in China's AI hardware ecosystem allows us to quickly identify and screen candidates with the right technical background and experience.",
      "q2": "What types of roles do you typically fill for AI hardware companies?",
      "a2": "We specialize in manufacturing, supply chain, and engineering roles including: Hardware Engineers, Manufacturing Engineers, Supply Chain Managers, Quality Engineers, Production Managers, and Procurement Specialists with AI/robotics experience.",
      "q3": "Do you provide ongoing support after placement?",
      "a3": "Yes, we provide 3-month placement guarantee and ongoing HR support to ensure successful integration. This includes performance check-ins, cultural adaptation support, and immediate replacement if needed.",
      "q4": "How do you ensure candidates understand both AI technology and manufacturing?",
      "a4": "Our candidates are pre-screened for both technical AI/robotics knowledge and hands-on manufacturing experience. We use competency frameworks specifically designed for AI hardware companies transitioning to mass production."

      "title": "Supply Chain Solutions",
      "q1": "What's included in your production feasibility assessment?",
      "a1": "Our 10-day assessment covers: component sourcing analysis, supplier capability evaluation, cost modeling, timeline projections, risk assessment, and detailed recommendations for pilot to mass production transition.",
      "q2": "How do you help with component sourcing for AI hardware?",
      "a2": "We leverage our supplier network to source critical components including chips, sensors, motors, and specialized parts. Our team provides supplier validation, cost negotiation, and quality assurance throughout the sourcing process.",
      "q3": "What support do you provide during production ramp-up?",
      "a3": "We provide on-site engineering support, production line optimization, quality control implementation, supplier relationship management, and real-time issue resolution during the critical ramp-up phase."
    },
    "general": {
      "title": "General Questions",
      "q1": "What's your recommended approach for AI hardware manufacturing strategy?",
      "a1": "We recommend a strategic multi-region approach to minimize costs. China is ideal for the product development phase due to its rich supporting resources and ecosystem that enables rapid prototyping and iteration. Once the product is mature, companies can migrate production to other regions based on cost considerations, market access, or supply chain requirements. This phased approach optimizes both development speed and long-term manufacturing economics.",
      "q2": "How do you handle cross-cultural and language barriers?",
      "a2": "Our bilingual team bridges communication gaps with standardized processes, translated documentation, and cultural training. We ensure smooth coordination between global teams and local Chinese suppliers/partners.",
      "q3": "What makes RobotLinked different from traditional consulting firms?",
      "a3": "We specialize exclusively in AI hardware and robotics with deep China manufacturing expertise. Our combined talent + solutions approach ensures you build the right team while implementing proven manufacturing strategies.",
      "q4": "Do you support manufacturing outside of China due to tariff concerns?",
      "a4": "Yes, we can help navigate alternative manufacturing locations when tariffs or geopolitical factors are a concern. We identify suppliers with relevant capabilities in regions like Southeast Asia, India, or Mexico, and provide on-site resources to ensure quality and coordination. Our global network allows us to maintain the same level of manufacturing excellence regardless of location."
