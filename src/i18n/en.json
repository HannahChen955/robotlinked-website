      "q1": "How quickly can you deliver qualified candidates for AI hardware roles?",
      "a1": "We deliver the first candidate batch within 48 hours for most AI hardware roles. Our AI-driven search process and China+ network let us match engineers, supply-chain specialists, and production experts fast — so AI-first teams can start building hardware execution capability immediately.",
      "q2": "What types of roles do you typically fill for AI hardware companies?",
      "a2": "We focus on key execution roles across manufacturing, supply-chain, and quality — including Hardware Engineers, Manufacturing Engineers, Supply Chain Managers, Quality Engineers, Production Managers, and TPMs experienced in AI hardware ramp-up.",
      "q3": "Do you provide support after placement?",
      "a3": "Yes — we stay engaged. RobotLinked offers 3-month post-placement support for onboarding, cultural integration, and performance feedback.",
      "q4": "How do you ensure candidates understand both AI and manufacturing?",

      "title": "Strategy & Operations",
      "q1": "What's your recommended approach for AI hardware manufacturing strategy?",
      "a1": "We suggest a China+ multi-region approach — prototype in China for speed and ecosystem access, then scale to other regions based on cost and market needs. This balances speed and supply-chain resilience.",
      "q2": "How do you handle cross-cultural and language barriers?",
      "a2": "Our bilingual execution team bridges engineering intent and factory execution through standardized processes and clear documentation.",
      "q3": "What makes RobotLinked different from traditional consulting firms?",
      "a3": "RobotLinked is not a consulting firm — we're an embedded execution partner for AI-first teams. We combine lightweight structure, AI-native workflow, and China+ supply chain expertise to turn design into reality.",
      "q4": "Do you support manufacturing outside of China due to tariff concerns?",
      "a4": "Yes, we can help navigate alternative manufacturing locations when tariffs or geopolitical factors are a concern. We identify suppliers with relevant capabilities in regions like Southeast Asia, India, or Mexico, and provide on-site resources to ensure quality and coordination. Our global network allows us to maintain the same level of manufacturing excellence regardless of location."
